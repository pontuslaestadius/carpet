# Before
It is expected you've read the README file on how to clone, run and test the software before contributing.

## Coding Guideline
Using [Google C++ coding guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with a [cmake formatter](https://github.com/kbenzie/git-cmake-format) all aspects of the project has their own standard. These two different guidelines are followed lightly and their enforcement is not required but is adviced to adhere to a similar structure of code writing.

## Getting started
To get started modifying the code, download a protected and stable branch or live dangerously and clone any branch! But your safest bet is a release branch or from the master branch. The next step is to find the file you want to modify, all of which are located in the src/ directory and any other files are not up to modification from outside contributors. 

## How do I contribute?
When you have your modified version which you are sure of will improve the existing software you can create a pull request in the public repository.
All pull requests are checked by Travis-CI to ensure that all test cases have been passed and then it will require manual confirmation and integration from one of the core contributors of the project.
