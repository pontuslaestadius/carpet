## Introduction
An self driving university car project based on the cloun library. The software is able to utitlize the OpenDaVinci library to follow a lane and perform Vehicle to Vehicle communication as well as platooning.


## Github Layout
The development branch serves as a place where tested code is integrated and collected in-between releases, while the master branch will serve as a place for the latest release/stable version.
Development of features is separated into branches with appropriate naming.
Test-cases will put within a separate folder to separate tests from deployment code.

When merging to master a release will be created to provide tracability.

Following these [guidelines](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
